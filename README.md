Geewhiz is a set of convenience scripts I use with the Unity 3d game engine.
They are based on a set of behaviors I find common in many of the games I've
worked on.  Many components are available in other forms, I prefer to make the
simplest solution to a particular problem possible.  It may not be the most
general, but it is a starting point for other use cases at the least.
